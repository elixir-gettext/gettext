    configuration option.

## v0.13.1

  * Fix a bug with Dialyzer specs for the `Gettext.Backend.ngettext_noop/2` callback
  * Parse `msgctxt` entries in PO and POT files so that they don't cause syntax
    errors, but ignore them in the parsed result

## v0.13.0

  * Add the `gettext_noop/1`, `dgettext_noop/2`, `ngettext_noop/3`, and
    `dngettext_noop/4` macros to Gettext backends. These macros can be used to
    mark messages for extractions without translating the given string

## v0.12.2

  * Fix a bug where we failed miserably with a "no process" error when
    extracting messages without having the `:gettext` compiler run
  * Slightly revisit the indentation of subsequent literal strings in dumped
    PO(T) files; before, they were dumped one per line, indented one level more
    than the parent message, while now they're indented at the same level as
    the parent message

## v0.12.1

  * Ensure the Gettext application is started before running Mix tasks

## v0.12.0

  * Drop support for Elixir 1.1 and require ~> 1.2
  * Add `:compiler_po_wildcard` to explicitly choose the po files that are
    tracked by the compiler
  * Allow the developer to configure what happens when there are missing
    bindings in the message. The default has been changed to log and return
    the incomplete string instead of raising
  * Move the configuration for the `:gettext` application to compile-time config
    in `project/0` in `mix.exs` (under the `:gettext` key, with configuration
    options `:excluded_refs_from_purging`, `:compiler_po_wildcard` and
    `:fuzzy_threshold`)
  * Show the file name in syntax errors when running `mix gettext.extract` and
    `mix gettext.merge`
  * Don't print tokens as Erlang terms in syntax error when running `mix
    gettext.extract` and `mix gettext.merge`
  * Allow duplicate interpolation keys
  * Raise when the domain is not a binary at compile-time
  * Fix many dialyzer warnings
  * No longer traverse directories given to `gettext.merge` recursively (from
    now on `gettext.merge` expect specific locale directories)
  * Re enable the "compile" task in `mix gettext.extract`
  * Ensure messages are tracked to the proper child app when using umbrella
    apps

## v0.11.0

  * Polish so many docs!
  * Make an error in `Gettext.put_locale/2` clearer
  * Pluralize `x_Y` locales as `x`, but fail with
    `Gettext.Plural.UnknownLocaleError` for any other unknown locale
  * Add a `Gettext.Backend` behaviour (automatically implemented if a module
    calls `use Gettext`)
  * Allow whitelisting of references via the `:excluded_refs_from_purging` option
    in the `:gettext` application config

## v0.10.0

  * Emit warnings when the domain passed to one of the `*gettext` macros has
    slashes in it (as we don't support domains in subdirectories).
  * Discard dangling comments when parsing/dumping PO(T) files (dangling
    comments are comments that are not followed by a transaction they can be
    attached to).
  * Updated informative comments for newly generated PO/POT files.

## v0.9.0

  * Strip `##` comments from POT files when they're being merged into PO files;
    these comments are comments meant to be generated by tools or directed at
    developers (so they have no use for translators in PO files).
  * Add informative comments at the top of newly generated PO/POT files.
  * Add `Gettext.known_locales/1`
  * Fix a bug with PO parsing when the PO file starts with a
    [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) character (which broke
    the parser, now a warning is issued).

## v0.8.0

  * Fix a bug with the `*gettext` macros, which raised an error when given
    compile-time strings in the form of `~s`/`~S` sigils.
  * Create missing locale directories (for example, `en/LC_MESSAGES`) when
    running the `gettext.merge` Mix task.
  * Fallback to default messages (that is, the `msgid`) when the `msgstr`
    (or one or more `msgstr` strings for plural messages) is empty.

## v0.7.0

  * When dumping PO files, dump as many references as possible on one line,
    wrapping at the 80th column
  * Parse multiple references in the same reference comment
  * Remove `Gettext.locale/0-1` and `Gettext.with_locale/2` in favour of
    `Gettext.get_locale/1`, `Gettext.put_locale/2`, and `Gettext.with_locale/3`
    which now work by setting/getting the locale on a per-backend basis (instead
    of a global one)
  * Remove the `:default_locale` config option for the `:gettext` application in
    favour of configuring the `:default_locale` for backends tied to their
    `:otp_app` (for example, `config :my_app, MyApp.Gettext, default_locale:
    "pt_BR"`)

## v0.6.1

  * Fix a bug with the `mix gettext.merge` task that was failing in Elixir
    v1.1.1 because `0.5 in 0..1` returns `false` with it

## v0.6.0

  * Add a `:flags` field to the `Gettext.PO.Translation` and
    `Gettext.PO.PluralTranslation` structs
  * Add support for fuzzy matching messages in `gettext.merge` and
    `gettext.extract --merge`
  * Add the `:fuzzy_threshold` configuration option for the `:gettext`
    application

## v0.5.0

  * Initial release
