defmodule Gettext.PO.PluralTranslation do
  @moduledoc """
  A struct that holds information on a plural translation.

  This struct describes a translation which has a plural form, such as the one
  in the following snippet of `.po` file:

      msgid "There was an error"
      msgid_plural "There were %{count} errors"
      msgstr[0] "C'Ã¨ stato un errore"
      msgstr[1] "Ci sono stati %{count} errori"

  This struct contains three fields:

    * `msgid` - the id of the singular translation.
    * `msgid_plural` - the id of the pluralized translation.
    * `msgstr` - a map which maps plural forms as keys to translated strings as
      values. The plural forms mentioned here are the ones described in
      `Gettext.Plural`.
    * `comments` - a list of comments as they are found in the PO file (e.g.,
      `["# foo"]`).
    * `references` - a list of references (files this translation comes from) in
      the form `{file, line}`.
    * `fuzzy` - a boolean that tells whether this translation was marked as
      fuzzy.
    * `po_source_line` - the line this translation is on in the PO file where it
      comes from.
