defmodule Gettext.PO.Translation do
  @moduledoc """
  A struct that holds information on a translation.

  This struct describes a translation that has no plural form, such as the one
  in the following snippet of `.po` file:

      msgid "Hello world!"
      msgstr "Ciao mondo!"

  Translations with a plural form are not represented as
  `Gettext.PO.Translation` structs, but as `Gettext.PO.PluralTranslation`
  structs.

  This struct contains two fields:

    * `msgid` - the id of the translation.
    * `msgstr` - the translated string.
    * `comments` - a list of translator comments as they are found in the PO file (e.g.,
      `["# foo"]`).
    * `extracted_comments`  - a list of comments extracted from the program source (e.g.,
      `["#. bar"]`).
    * `references` - a list of references (files this translation comes from) in
      the form `{file, line}`.
    * `flags` - a set of flags for this translation.
    * `po_source_line` - the line this translation is on in the PO file where it
      comes from.
