  # existing POT files if necessary.

  #
  # Ordering is mostly taken care of in merge_template/2, where we go over the
  # translations in an existing POT file and merge them if necessary (thus
  # keeping the order from the original file), then adding the translations from
  # the new in-memory POT (sorted by name).
